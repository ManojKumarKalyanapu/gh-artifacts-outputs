What Are Job Artifacts?
Artifacts are files generated during a workflow run (e.g., test results, build outputs, logs) that you want to save and share between jobs or download after a run.

How to Use Artifacts
GitHub provides two built-in actions to handle artifacts:
1. Upload Artifact
- name: Upload build artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-artifact
    path: ./build/

| Key    | Description                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `name` | Name of the artifact.           |
| `path` | File(s) or folder(s) to upload. |

2. Download Artifact
- name: Download build artifact
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-artifact
    path: ./downloaded/

| Key    | Description                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `name` | Name of the artifact to download. |
| `path` | Destination directory.            |


Sharing Artifacts Between Jobs
Use upload-artifact in one job and download-artifact in another job. Make sure the downloading job uses needs: to depend on the uploading job.

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "build output" > output.txt
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: result
          path: output.txt

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: result
      - run: cat output.txt

| Limit             | Value                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Retention         | Default 90 days (customizable) |
| Max artifact size | 5 GB per artifact              |
| Max total per run | 10 GB                          |

Artifacts are stored per workflow run, and are downloadable from the GitHub UI or via the GitHub API.

Best Practices
✅ Use artifacts to share data between jobs.

✅ Archive build outputs, test reports, or logs.

❌ Don't store sensitive information (use secrets or encrypted storage).

✅ Clean up unnecessary files before uploading.
